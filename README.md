## How to : use the program

On the dump, you will see a file and a folder. the program is contained in the main.py file and the library in the
folder, so don't delete or modify anything.

![img.png](readme/img.png)

you will have to keep this configuration so the program can work.
Now, we'll open a command prompt, and move in the current directory:

![img_1.png](readme/img_1.png)

Now that we are in the correct directory, we will execute the following command:
> **python main.py**
![img_2.png](readme/img_2.png)

This command applies itself in Windows, Linux, and Mac.
Once you executed this command, you will have to wait shortly to see two new files in your directory:

![img_3.png](readme/img_3.png)

Those are the two files. One of them is a JSON file, it won't interest us, so we can remov it if we want to. The file
with the 'tab-' prefixe is the one that interest us and has the data with the correct format for usage.
